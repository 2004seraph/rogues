# **Rogues-Online**
My Computer Science project; a 2D web-based multiplayer platform fighting game.

## TODO List (Musts):
 - [x] when you tab out and tab back in the colliders will break
 - [x] update position every frame
 - [x] update attacks as they are made
 - [x] update everything else every 10 frames
 - [x] add all login prompts
 - [ ] show usernames on gameover screen in multiplayer
 - [ ] add one more stage
 - [x] add speedy character
 - [ ] add heavy character
 - [ ] add first median character
 - [ ] add second median character
 - [ ] add competitve matchmaking for Elo

## Coulds:
 - [ ] lobby text-chat

## Bugs:
  - characters playing the exact same animation will both use the same animation progress, hence, will both iterate the animations progress
  - very rarely players wont both load the same map in multiplayer sometimes if they both vote on different stages
  - very rarely the game will just not load
  - very rarely the character/stage select screen will fail in multiplayer

## Maybe:
 - [ ] 2^n stepped screen resolution changes
 - [ ] try vector-midpoint collsion detection
 - [ ] minify the game
